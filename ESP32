-For programming ESP32 board with Arduino IDE first step is to add ESP32 board support on Arduino IDE. For this follow the steps below:
1-Open Arduino IDE go to “File” in menu bar and open “Preferences”
2-As “Preferences” dialog box opens, copy the URL in “Additional Board Manager URLs” box.After this select “OK”.
