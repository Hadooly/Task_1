In this repository i did two tasks.

# Speech to text
In this file i did a simple program to convert speech to text by using javascript,  
So the user will press the mic button to record the voice and then the program will convert it into text (support Arabic language).

# ESP32
Here I wrote simple steps on how to operate ESP32 with Arduino.
